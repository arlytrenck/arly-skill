# coverage.sh - compare TOOLS.md and ENTRY.md with what the public repos contain
#
# Usage: scripts/coverage.sh [-h]
#
# Reads the file lists of sysadmin-linux, sysadmin-windows, and homelab-public
# from GitHub and reports three things:
#   1. Scripts in those repos that TOOLS.md does not mention.
#   2. File names that TOOLS.md or ENTRY.md cite that no longer exist in them.
#   3. Runbooks, checklists, or templates TOOLS.md names that ENTRY.md never
#      cites anywhere, so a matching situation would have nothing to route to.
# Docs are otherwise checked only for existence when cited, not for
# completeness: a cheatsheet or reference doc TOOLS.md leaves out is not an
# error the way an unrouted runbook is. It never edits anything. Run it
# during a refresh, after scripts/check.sh.
#
# Options:
#   -h    Show this help and exit.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every script is listed and every cited file exists
#   1  one or more findings
#   2  bad usage or a missing tool
#   3  a repo's file list could not be read
