# OPINIONS.md

A compact map of Arly Trenck's viewpoints, taken only from what he has published: his blog at trenck.net, the READMEs and docs in his public repos, and his GitHub profile. It is written for use as LLM context, so repeated points are consolidated and evidence links are kept to one or two per entry.

Where an entry says "Arly's practice", it is describing what he does on his own systems. Where it says "Arly thinks", it is a stated view. Do not present either as more than that.

_Last updated: 2026-10-07_
_Sources: 17 published blog posts (2026-09-08 through 2026-10-07), `homelab-public` docs, `sysadmin-linux` and `sysadmin-windows` READMEs, CONTRIBUTING, and `docs/`, the profile README._

## Monitoring and alerting

### Monitoring is only real if it reaches a person

Arly thinks the test of whether a system is monitored is "would I find out about a real problem without going looking for it", not "can I query this metric". A dashboard full of green panels is a museum: somebody still has to walk through it. Removing that somebody is most of what monitoring is for.
He does not think this is a homelab-scale problem. A well-instrumented enterprise system with no alerting on the metrics that matter is discovered down the same way an unmonitored one is, by someone noticing the service is gone.
The bar he holds his own systems to: would this have reached my phone before I noticed on my own. He admits he has not finished answering that for two of his own systems.

### Alert on a handful of things you trust

Alerting on everything is the opposite mistake. It buries real signal until dismissing notifications becomes a reflex, and an alert nobody trusts does the same work as no alert. He treats "what deserves to page someone" as a design decision, and prefers a handful of alerts he trusts completely over a hundred he has learned to ignore.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/monitoring-without-alerting-is-a-museum/

### Keep one monitor independent of the thing it watches

In his stack, Uptime Kuma is deliberately separate from Prometheus, so black-box checks keep working when Prometheus is down. Backup freshness is a metric, with an alert when any job's last success goes stale, so a job that quietly stopped is visible.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/monitoring-and-alerting.md

### A feature meant for resilience can create the failure it exists to catch

Alertmanager's gossip clustering, left on with a single instance, wedged the dispatcher after failed deliveries and silently stopped all alerts until a restart. His summary: a gossip cluster with no peer is a single point of failure wearing an HA feature's name. Check what a default is actually doing for your topology.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/lessons-learned.md

### Scope self-healing deliberately

Auto-restart is applied to stateless or easily resumed services, where a silent recovery beats a 2am page. Databases are excluded because restarting mid-transaction can do more harm than a human investigating. The identity provider (Authelia) is excluded because an auth outage should be seen immediately, not auto-remediated. The alert-delivery path is excluded because a mis-firing healthcheck plus auto-restart could loop or mask the very outage it should report.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/hardening-conventions.md

### Detect first, then block, and alert on the watcher

Arly's practice with CrowdSec on the public Caddy vhosts: run the engine with no bouncer for a week, so it parses logs and raises alerts but touches no traffic. A ban on a public service can lock out the one person who needs in, himself included, so the design starts with a never-ban list (LAN, tailnet, Docker bridges, loopback) and has Caddy judge the real client address behind Cloudflare, not Cloudflare's edge. Detection data is how he finds false positives without anyone getting a 403 from a guess. The bouncer went live on October 4 after a week of clean detection.
The watcher gets its own alerts: one if the engine stops answering, one if it is up but has read no log lines for a day, which is the quiet failure of a broken log block or a stale rotated file. He fails open once a bouncer exists, and says that makes the down alert matter more: fail-open without an alert is a switch that turns itself off. He lists the unlogged apex site as a known gap.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/crowdsec-detection-only-on-caddy/

### Automation that only reads is safe to run everywhere

Arly thinks most automation should be unable to change anything: read state, compare it to expectation, send a message. Its worst bug is a wrong notification, so it can run every twenty minutes, unattended, with broad visibility and no test environment, and adding one costs no thought about misfires. Detection and remediation carry different risk, and bundling them makes the safe half inherit the risky half's blast radius. Read-only intent also needs scoped credentials: a dedicated key per job, and an ordinary user where root is not needed.
He lets automation act only when the action is narrow, pre-decided, and what a person would do anyway (autoheal restarting a container unhealthy for several minutes, Renovate opening a pull request). He avoids anything shaped like "detect a class of problem and apply whatever fix seems appropriate", because that makes a judgment call at 3am with no reviewer.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/most-of-my-automation-cant-change-anything/

## Metrics and reporting

### Closure speed measures throughput, not health

Arly thinks a fast-closing ticket queue is a weak headline health number, even though monthly reports tend to treat it as one. A quickly closed ticket can mean the cause was fixed. It can just as easily mean the symptom went quiet long enough to hit "resolved", after which the same request returns under a new number and counts as a fresh success.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/ticket-metrics-measure-activity-not-health/

### Prefer recurrence, and be honest about what it costs

The metric he would use instead is repeat-ticket rate by root cause, one level below the surface category. A downward trend there means the problem stopped. It is more work to produce: tickets have to be grouped by root cause, not by the label typed at intake, and one underlying problem often shows up as several unrelated tickets. Closure time already exists as a column, while recurrence is a project, so reports default to closure time. His clearest example is password and MFA resets: each closes in minutes and looks like a win, yet they were the biggest repeat source until self-service guides and live sessions took most of them away, while the closure number barely moved. He says Freshservice reports now give him the recurrence view without regrouping the queue by hand each month.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/ticket-metrics-measure-activity-not-health/ and https://trenck.net/blog/recurrence-is-the-ticket-metric-i-actually-want/

## Change management and access control

### An access-control rollout is a change-management project

Arly thinks the technical work of MFA, conditional access, or a new SSO policy is the small part: a few settings, a policy document, a test account. What decides success is the organizational effort around it. Rollouts break on the traveling employee with no signal, the shared workstation where "whose phone is this" has no answer, the person on leave when enforcement lands, and the manager who hears about it from a locked-out employee before IT tells them. His sequencing: pilot with a willing, visible group, announce the date earlier than feels necessary, and enforce office by office so the help desk is not taking every call in one week.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/security-rollouts-fail-on-people/ and https://trenck.net/blog/mfa-rollouts-are-a-change-management-project/

### Design the failure path first

The first design question is what happens when this fails for a legitimate person outside business hours, and how long they are stuck. If the answer is "until the help desk opens", the rollout is not ready. A control with no fast, legitimate exception path does not remove risk. It moves the risk into a workaround nobody wrote down. Build the exception path before enforcement, not after the first ticket, so its failure mode is an admin making a five-minute judgment call.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/security-rollouts-fail-on-people/ and https://trenck.net/blog/mfa-rollouts-are-a-change-management-project/

### Judge a rollout six months later

A rollout that grades itself a success on launch day is measuring the wrong thing. Arly's metric is whether it is still on and unmodified six months later. What goes wrong shows up slowly: shared logins because individual accounts were too much friction, an exception list that grew until it swallowed the policy, a "temporary" bypass that outlived its approver. Pilot with a visible, cooperative group, and announce the timeline further ahead than feels necessary.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/security-rollouts-fail-on-people/

### Controls are worth doing firmly, and are not finished when configured

He is not against MFA, conditional access, or tightly scoped SSO. He thinks they are worth doing firmly. His pushback is on calling any of them finished the moment they are configured: the technology enforces a policy, and whether the policy holds depends on months of change management nobody scoped time for.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/security-rollouts-fail-on-people/

## Defaults, hardening, and secrets

### The default is the thing to go check

Two lessons from his own systems point the same way. Authelia's `default_policy` is deny, so a new subdomain with no matching rule is locked out for everyone. Container ports default to `0.0.0.0`, and a media-library manager's VNC port (5900) sat unauthenticated on `0.0.0.0`, reachable from the LAN, until an audit caught it. His rule: find out what the default is, then look at what is actually bound or matched, on a schedule.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/authelia-two-file-access-control-bug/ and https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/lessons-learned.md

### Audit the interface nobody monitors

Arly's practice: he went through his server's baseboard management controller end to end after it had run for years on day-one settings. It had legacy protocols on that he had never deliberately used (IPMI-over-LAN, SLP, SSDP, CIM-over-HTTPS) and stray RDP and VNC port forwards. He turned the protocols off, removed the forwards, enabled audit logging and set a password-expiration policy. Expect that enabling expiration counts the current password's age retroactively, so plan the change first. He thinks the BMC stays unaudited because it sits outside the monitoring the OS gets and is never what he is thinking about.
The remaining risk was network placement, not settings: it sat on the flat LAN, which took a network redesign. As of October 7 it is on a management VLAN, and the certificate is still self-signed, which he says plainly.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/bmc-hardening-the-forgotten-interface/

### One baseline on every service

Every service in his stack sets `no-new-privileges`, a restart policy, a healthcheck, a timezone, and log rotation. Every service has a memory limit and a process limit, sized as ceilings at roughly three to four times observed use. Ports publish on `127.0.0.1` behind a reverse proxy, or on a specific LAN address, never `0.0.0.0`. Databases get a long stop grace period so they checkpoint cleanly. A service that skips part of the baseline carries a comment saying why (a distroless image with no shell for a healthcheck, the alert path kept off auto-restart), and a service that drifts from it without one is treated as a bug.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public#conventions

### Secrets stay out of tracked files, and out of scratch files

Secrets never live in a compose file or any tracked file. Each stack reads an untracked env file with restrictive permissions, and documents every key, without values, in an `.env.example`. He also counts untracked plaintext as a problem: two credential files left on disk as quick notes-to-self were found in an audit. If you write a password down during setup, move it to a password manager and delete the scratch file.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/lessons-learned.md

## Troubleshooting

### One change, two places: verify both

A reverse proxy handing the access decision to a separate service is a two-step change. Caddy's `forward_auth` declares where to ask. Authelia's `access_control` declares what the answer is. Nothing shows both at once, so a correct-looking proxy block can sit in front of a rule that does not exist. The shape generalizes to nginx `auth_request` and Traefik `forwardAuth`. After adding a protected route, read the authorization side's own rule list and find the route by name.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/authelia-two-file-access-control-bug/

### Fixing one instance does not tell you the fix generalized

When the same bug appeared twice in a day, he fixed both and moved on without asking why. Later he found the same gap on three more vhosts. In his words: "Having fixed something earlier tells you one instance is gone. It says nothing about whether the fix generalized." He now keeps a checklist next to the most recently added vhost listing both halves of the change.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/authelia-two-file-access-control-bug/

### Test the way a real user hits it

Testing a protected route means an actual browser that is not already authenticated. `curl` from inside the LAN can pass the real check for an entirely different reason.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/authelia-two-file-access-control-bug/

### Ask the authoritative source

When DNS looks right in every tool except the one failing, query the authoritative nameserver directly, not a public resolver. A resolver returns what it last cached, which is the wrong answer when the origin data never finished publishing. Rule out the obvious suspects first (token scope, a typo, propagation delay), then stop guessing.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/cloudflare-stuck-dns-publish-fix/

### A fix downstream does not restart what is upstream

After correcting the DNS record, Caddy's ACME client was still backing off exponentially from its earlier failures, so fixing DNS did not trigger a retry. A restart cleared the backoff. When you repair a dependency, check whether the consumer is waiting out its own delay.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/cloudflare-stuck-dns-publish-fix/

### Same failure twice earns a runbook entry

The stuck-DNS fix worked twice, months apart, on different subdomains. It went into the runbook: recreate the record, confirm against the authoritative server, restart Caddy. His stated payoff is five minutes next time instead of an afternoon second-guessing a token that was never the problem.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/cloudflare-stuck-dns-publish-fix/

### Check the network layer before blaming the firewall

If a public-facing service works from outside but fails from inside the LAN, check for NAT hairpinning before assuming a firewall or DNS misconfiguration. The fix is a local resolver overriding those specific names to the LAN address, not a change to the service. Arly's practice is AdGuard Home answering with the reverse proxy's internal address, offered network-wide by the router over DHCP, since an opt-in fix only helps devices that were configured. He notes it looks like a dead service from the client side, so the first hour went into proxy logs. Comparing what a client outside the LAN saw against one inside took two minutes. The open gap he states: that one resolver is the only DNS the router offers, so rebooting its VM takes DNS down LAN-wide. A second instance on a separate failure domain is planned, not built, and a public fallback would defeat the local answers.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/nat-hairpin-and-local-dns/ and https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/lessons-learned.md

## Tooling and dependencies

### Stop at the second fork

The upstream of the Watchtower he ran (`containrrr/watchtower`) is abandoned, and his stack had already moved to the community `nickfedor/*` fork to keep receiving updates. Fork-hopping a second time is where he stops and picks a different tool.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/watchtower-to-renovate/

### An update should arrive as a diff, a CI run, and a changelog

A phone notification that an image tag moved says nothing about what changed, does not check that the new version starts, and leaves no record. He moved image updates to Renovate pull requests that run the existing validation workflow before he merges. Nothing auto-applies: the `docker compose up -d` is always a deliberate human action. The CI that gates those PRs is held to the same bar: third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to a commit SHA with the version in a comment, and Renovate bumps the pins, since a repo meant to show a hardened setup should not leave its own CI supply chain on mutable tags.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/watchtower-to-renovate/ and https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

### Let the grouping encode the judgment calls

Rolling `:latest` tags are digest-pinned and batched into one weekly PR, since they have no changelog to read. Version-tagged images get their own PR with the changelog attached. Components that must stay in lockstep move as a group. Authelia, Vaultwarden, and major versions of Postgres and Valkey are flagged individually for a manual release-notes read, because taking those updates is a decision about data formats or auth behavior. Version bumps stay manual for good. Auto-merge is planned only for digest-only bumps, after a few clean weeks.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/watchtower-to-renovate/

### Document the exceptions

What Renovate does not manage (anything in `.env`, so Immich's version) is a documented exception, not a gap. A PR nobody merges without reading the notes is just noise. The older registry-digest script stays as an out-of-band check on what the primary tracker misses.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/watchtower-to-renovate/

### Do not add a second tool if the first already does the job

He deployed Rundeck to get run history and a UI for cron-driven backups, then removed it the same day. n8n, already running, could do the same job (trigger a script over SSH on a schedule, log it, alert on failure) at no extra memory. Rundeck's real advantages, multi-user RBAC and audit policies, answered a question a single-operator setup never asked.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/lessons-learned.md

### Write the rollback triggers before starting, and be willing to cancel

For a planned Emby to Jellyfin move, Arly wrote down rollback triggers in advance so he could not talk himself into or out of them later, and made the risky part (each user's watch state) a gated step with a read-only diff and a 99 percent bar. Emby stayed untouched until the last phase. In October he decided to stay on Emby and cancelled the cutover because the migration cost outweighed the benefit, and he left the plan post up as written with the update on top. The reasons to leave had been small (closed code, a license tied to one server, a stack leaning toward Jellyfin), not a failure.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/emby-to-jellyfin-migration-plan/

## Backups and recovery

### A backup you have not restored is a belief

Arly's practice is a monthly restore drill that restores a canary set, decrypts the newest database dump, loads it into a throwaway database container, and counts rows. That is a real "does it restore", not "does the file exist". Results are pushed as a notification, and backup freshness is a metric with an alert.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/backup-strategy.md

### Recovery targets are a budget, not a hope

RPO (how much data loss is acceptable) and RTO (how long recovery is allowed to take) get set honestly, per service, before the backup mechanism is chosen. A 15-minute RTO for a database that takes 45 minutes to restore means the RTO is unrealistic or the restore strategy has to change, not that the number gets rounded up after the fact once reality shows up. He also fixes the order services come back in: core infrastructure and data stores before anything user-facing, and monitoring restored early enough to watch the rest of the recovery, not last.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/sysadmin-linux/blob/main/docs/disaster-recovery-plan-template.md

### State what the design does not protect against

His backup doc has a section on the gaps. Two copies in one physical location is not 3-2-1, and a nightly mirror faithfully replicates a deletion or corruption within about a day. He names the missing leg (an off-site target) instead of implying coverage he does not have. Mirrors that delete carry a `--max-delete` circuit breaker and a trash directory.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/backup-strategy.md

### Sort what the NAS holds before deciding what to back up

Data on a NAS is not one category. A re-acquirable media library can be excluded on purpose, if the exclusion is stated. Family photographs and anything with an unreproducible capture date is the row that matters, usually a small share of the volume: backing up a whole share to protect the photos could mean tens of TB of transfer to save tens of GB. He sets RPO and RTO for that second group separately, and says an RTO timed from a same-building mirror measures the wrong scenario.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/backup-strategy.md

### Layer backups by what is being protected

Config, databases, secrets, and history each get a mechanism that fits: nightly config sync, dumped-and-encrypted databases with rotation and checksums, encrypted secret bundles, and a versioned repository with retention and an integrity check on every run.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/homelab-public/blob/main/docs/backup-strategy.md

## Documentation and reuse

### Scripts get read before they get run

His scripts are built to be read: each documents its own options, and the PowerShell ones carry comment-based help and `-WhatIf`. Contributions are held to the same bar: match the header style, fail safely, prefer erroring out to guessing, and put destructive actions behind an explicit flag.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/sysadmin-linux#why-this-repo-exists and https://github.com/arlytrenck/sysadmin-linux/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

### Keep the explanation inside the thing it explains

Arly thinks a separate notes document goes stale because nothing forces it to change when the script does. What stays accurate is the header and comments in the script itself: what it does, why a flag is set that way, what broke the last time someone tried the obvious alternative. Editing code while leaving the explanation beside it untouched feels wrong in a way that ignoring a wiki page never does. His example is `backup-rotate.sh`, whose comments read like a small incident log: an unvalidated `-k` once made the prune find nothing yet print "Nothing to prune" and exit 0, so retention quietly stopped. Anyone tempted to simplify the code can see what the simpler version cost. This covers operational detail, not architecture: diagrams and why a system exists still need their own writing. His test: if he cannot tell what a script does and why from the script itself six months later, the gap is in the script.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/the-best-documentation-you-never-have-to-read/ and https://trenck.net/blog/my-best-documentation-lives-in-the-scripts/

### The docs get opened more than the scripts get run

Most days the work is a command whose shape is familiar but not the exact flags, so cheatsheets are used more than any single script. Docs favor concrete commands over abstract advice, and state their assumptions (privileges, package manager).
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/sysadmin-linux#why-this-repo-exists

### Parameterize, then publish

The step that makes a script reusable across a few hosts (parameterizing paths, thresholds, package manager) is most of the work to make it reusable by others, so he publishes instead of keeping it private. Vendor-specific tooling is out of scope, because it mostly helps people already paying that vendor. Split the toolkit by platform, not by task, so generalizing stays cheap and each repo needs one shell and one linter.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/sysadmin-linux#why-this-repo-exists

### Write for whoever hits the problem next

His blog skips getting-started material, since good writing already exists, and covers what comes after: what you set up correctly a year ago that breaks in a way the logs do not explain, or the tool that was right when chosen and stopped being right without saying so. He writes while still in the middle of something, so posts read as notes. Some are narrow enough to be a note to himself.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/welcome-to-the-blog/

## Practice and craft

### Run the homelab like production

Config in git, one command to rebuild the host, backups actually restored from, hardened Compose stacks behind a reverse proxy, and alerting that reaches a phone. Arly treats the homelab as practice for the work he does at the enterprise scale, and calls out his own gaps in public.
Evidence: https://github.com/arlytrenck/arlytrenck and https://trenck.net/blog/welcome-to-the-blog/

### Fixed limits are the point

Arly's homelab is one Proxmox host with 16 cores and 62 GiB of RAM, carrying a single VM with 55 containers. He thinks unlimited hardware teaches bad habits, because "more hardware or another VM" is always the easy answer. A fixed ceiling forces the trade-offs an employer's budget would, and the skill he practices is saying no to his own ideas. He adds that limits only help when they match real ones: starving a lab on purpose teaches little.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/a-homelab-needs-limits-to-be-good-practice/

### Say when it is an opinion

His writing keeps two lanes apart: field notes about a specific thing that happened on the real homelab, and opinions with no single incident behind them. When he is giving an opinion, he says so instead of hedging it into something that sounds like consensus.
Evidence: https://trenck.net/blog/welcome-to-the-blog/
