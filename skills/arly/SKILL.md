# /arly

The current instructions for this skill live in `arlytrenck/arly-skill`, not in
this file. Load them as described below, then follow them to answer the request.
If the files cannot be loaded, stop and say so. Do not guess file contents.

## Loading instructions (session-cached)

Read the **full** content of `ENTRY.md`. It is a short router. It tells you which
one or two other files to read for the question, among `topics/<name>.md`,
`OPINIONS.md` with `opinions/<section>.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `VOICE.md`.

Where to read each file from, in order:

1. If the working directory is a clone of `arlytrenck/arly-skill`, read the local files.
2. Otherwise fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arlytrenck/arly-skill/main/<path>`.
3. If raw.githubusercontent.com fails, fall back to
   `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arlytrenck/arly-skill@main/<path>`.

Rules:

1. If a file was already read in full earlier in this session, do not fetch it again.
2. Do not read any other file from the repo unless `ENTRY.md` says to.
3. After loading `ENTRY.md`, follow it exactly, reading only the files it routes you to.
